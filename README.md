# 32.-DSTA-BrainHack-CTF-Hackathon-2025
Prior to this hackathon, I knew next to nothing about Cybersecurity.

This repo stores my documentation of my learning journey to taking part in 
this hackathon, my first CTF hackathkn.

But I have learnt alot in preperation for this hackathon.

Learnt from a previous international CTF organised by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
called PicoCTF 2017.

In the video he went through many tools used in Cybersecurity and how to answer
CTF questions and its various categories.
